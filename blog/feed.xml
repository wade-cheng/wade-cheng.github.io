    I have a habit of, often when gaming, calling someone who knows how to do
    anything but the most obvious and beginner thing, a nerd. Aw man this guy
    just killed me by executing the basic combo relevant to their character,
    their bread and butter? Oh my god this guy&#39;s a nerd :0
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    The connotation is important, though: it&#39;s not making fun of the person at
    all, I think it just makes life more happy to be easily impressed. Maybe
    they came into the game playing that character for the first time, and they
    had enough prior experience to just get it right with zero effort. Or maybe
    this is a beginner who spent long hours of practice to now be able to show
    it off. No matter what, even if it&#39;s something that&#39;s relatively simple to
    me, now, hey. That was pretty cool, anyways.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is about League of Legends.&lt;/p&gt;
