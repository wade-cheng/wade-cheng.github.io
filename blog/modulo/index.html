        <p><span style="font-variant-caps: small-caps">One pattern that exists as part of the English language</span> goes along the lines of “this is true, minus x.” Minus is the interesting part here: it expresses the equivalent of “except x,” which makes sense, because the mathematical subtraction operator, y’know, takes away things.</p>
        <p>Some time ago, I watched a short video by <a href="https://www.etymologynerd.com/">etymologynerd</a>, who talked about how there’s some kind of subdialect, or at least, special vocabulary used among math and CS nerds—how people at institutions like Carnegie Mellon disproportionately end up saying words like such that, nonzero, or subset. Similarly to this idea, I occasionally see people on programming forums and such say “this is true, modulo x” as another turn of phrase.</p>
        <p>This is really cool! Instead of “this is true, except for these cases, take these cases away, subtract them entirely,” they found a way to express “this is true, but perhaps not really, the real truth is some peculiar transformation of this statement that retains part but not all of the real truth.” Sometimes this is helpful in statements that are meant to teach part of a concept, but revealing the whole truth would just confuse the learner. Like: “yeah, you don’t want to florbick the grimmet, uhhh, modulo perriwinkle-related concerns, but you shouldn’t worry about that right now.”</p>
        <p>Hmm, well, the examples used them more fluidly, so it’s a shame I don’t remember any. Anyway, language evolution is cool :)</p>
