        <p>I have a habit of, often when gaming, calling someone who knows how to do anything but the most obvious and beginner thing, a nerd. Aw man this guy just killed me by executing the basic combo relevant to their character, their bread and butter? Oh my god this guy’s a nerd :0</p>
        <p>The connotation is important, though: it’s not making fun of the person at all, I think it just makes life more happy to be easily impressed. Maybe they came into the game playing that character for the first time, and they had enough prior experience to just get it right with zero effort. Or maybe this is a beginner who spent long hours of practice to now be able to show it off. No matter what, even if it’s something that’s relatively simple to me, now, hey. That was pretty cool, anyways.</p>
        <p>Yes, this is about League of Legends.</p>
