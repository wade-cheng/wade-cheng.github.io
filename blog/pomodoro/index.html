        <p><span style="font-variant-caps: small-caps">I’ve been trying the pomodoro method recently.</span> I believe the canonical set of instructions is</p>
        <ul>
          <li>25 minute work session</li>
          <li>5 minute break</li>
          <li>repeat, extending the break to 20 minutes every four cycles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The idea is to cut down on burnout and be able to dedicate time to full, 100% concentration. The name comes from the Italian word for tomato, which is what the original inventor’s kitchen countdown timer was presumably shaped like.</p>
        <p>I think the idea is pretty cool. In a vaccum, I have the issue of hyper-focusing when things get interesting, which leaves me feeling drained. Or I don’t want to start work I perceive as stressful. So I usually end up taking long breaks or procrastinating work. With the tomato idea, I can instead tell myself “pspspsps it’s only a short work time it won’t be an extended length of Bad don’t worry you’re so okay” which is helpful for motivation.</p>
        <p>There exists another interesting perspective toward this rigid timeline, which I’ll explain via a quick side example. A friend once mentioned to me that they always take the stairs, <em>especially</em> when an elevator is available, because it’s one less decision they have to make. Wowee! Cool! This principle applies to this work-rest scheduling issue for me. Even if I feel like I want more or less time to work than 25 minutes, or if I feel like I want more or less time to rest than five, I take the predetermined time anyways. There’s some inefficiency where working more or resting less gets more work done, but I gladly trade that for staving off burnout and the mitigating the undesired sections of the contingency table: wanting to work less or rest longer.</p>
        <p>I track the time bounds with my analog watch, which is great because I just look for the minute hands reaching the top and bottom of the watch face. I usually skip long breaks or make them 30 minutes long to fit everything into watch-face-compatible blocks. I often also hide the clock widget on my laptop’s taskbar so I’m not peeking at it too often—I can just look at my watch instead. I find I work best when there’s as few moving parts (not controlled by me) on my screen as possible.</p>
        <p>As a final note, I use the Hank Green’s Focus Friend app to additionally motivate me to keep on track. It also helps me get out of an unproductive rut by setting a quick five minute “focus” period and using that to just stand up and start moving. That is, anytime I’m taking a too-long break, perhaps after a meal or before I leave the study lounge to go get ready before bed, etc etc.</p>
