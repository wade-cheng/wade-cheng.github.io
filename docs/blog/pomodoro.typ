I've been trying the pomodoro method recently. I believe the canonical set
of instructions is

- 25 minute work session
- 5 minute break
- repeat, extending the break to 20 minutes every four cycles

The idea is to cut down on burnout and be able to dedicate time to full,
100% concentration. The name comes from the Italian word for tomato, which
is what the original inventor's kitchen countdown timer was presumably
shaped like.

I think the idea is pretty cool. In a vaccum, I have the issue of
hyper-focusing when things get interesting, which leaves me feeling drained.
Or I don't want to start work I perceive as stressful. So I usually end up
taking long breaks or procrastinating work. With the tomato idea, I can
instead tell myself "pspspsps it's only a short work time it won't be an
extended length of Bad don't worry you're so okay" which is helpful for
motivation.

There exists another interesting perspective toward this rigid timeline,
which I'll explain via a quick side example. A friend once mentioned to me
that they always take the stairs, _especially_ when an elevator is
available, because it's one less decision they have to make. Wowee! Cool!
This principle applies to this work-rest scheduling issue for me. Even if I
feel like I want more or less time to work than 25 minutes, or if I feel
like I want more or less time to rest than five, I take the predetermined
time anyways. There's some inefficiency where working more or resting less
gets more work done, but I gladly trade that for staving off burnout and the
mitigating the undesired sections of the contingency table: wanting to work
less or rest longer.

I track the time bounds with my analog watch, which is great because I just
look for the minute hands reaching the top and bottom of the watch face. I
usually skip long breaks or make them 30 minutes long to fit everything into
watch-face-compatible blocks. I often also hide the clock widget on my
laptop's taskbar so I'm not peeking at it too often---I can just look at
my watch instead. I find I work best when there's as few moving parts (not
controlled by me) on my screen as possible.

As a final note, I use the Hank Green's Focus Friend app to additionally
motivate me to keep on track. It also helps me get out of an unproductive
rut by setting a quick five minute "focus" period and using that to just
stand up and start moving. That is, anytime I'm taking a too-long break,
perhaps after a meal or before I leave the study lounge to go get ready
before bed, etc etc.
