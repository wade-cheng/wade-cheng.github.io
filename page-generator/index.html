<p>Hello! I'm Wade. Welcome to my personal site!</p>

<p>University student at Carnegie Mellon for StatML. Or: A nerd attending nerd school.</p>

<h2>what's this?</h2>

Partially a personal site, yes, but it's pretty barren right now. Call it half personal site, half tech demo. This website is built with a handcrafted python script instead of a conventional static site generator like <a href="https://www.11ty.dev"/>https://www.11ty.dev/</a>, or something.
