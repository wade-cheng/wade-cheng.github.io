When I say "huzzah," I am referencing Joel Haver's animated series #link("https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKtIcOP0WvJB29YkQlSKhxwsab4JlysSj")[RPG].

It is very very good, in writing and cinematography and music and special effects. It is a comedy and also more than that. I love when that happens.

Give it a watch.
