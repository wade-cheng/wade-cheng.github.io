    I've been trying the pomodoro method recently. I believe the canonical set
    of instructions is
</p>

<ol class="tight">
    <li>25 minute work session</li>
    <li>5 minute break</li>
    <li>repeat, extending the break to 20 minutes every four cycles</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The idea is to cut down on burnout and be able to dedicate time to full,
    100% concentration. The name comes from the Italian word for tomato, which
    is what the original inventor's kitchen countdown timer was presumably
    shaped like.
</p>

<p>
    I think the idea is pretty cool. In a vaccum, I have the issue of
    hyper-focusing when things get interesting, which leaves me feeling drained.
    Or I don't want to start work I perceive as stressful. So I usually end up
    taking long breaks or procrastinating work. With the tomato idea, I can
    instead tell myself "pspspsps it's only a short work time it won't be an
    extended length of Bad don't worry you're so okay" which is helpful for
    motivation.
</p>

    There exists another interesting perspective toward this rigid timeline,
    which I'll explain via a quick side example. A friend once mentioned to me
    that they always take the stairs, <em>especially</em> when an elevator is
    available, because it's one less decision they have to make. Wowee! Cool!
    This principle applies to this work-rest scheduling issue for me. Even if I
    feel like I want more or less time to work than 25 minutes, or if I feel
    like I want more or less time to rest than five, I take the predetermined
    time anyways. There's some inefficiency where working more or resting less
    gets more work done, but I gladly trade that for staving off burnout and the
    mitigating the undesired sections of the contingency table: wanting to work
    less or rest longer.
</p>

    I track the time bounds with my analog watch, which is great because I just
    look for the minute hands reaching the top and bottom of the watch face. I
    usually skip long breaks or make them 30 minutes long to fit everything into
    watch-face-compatible blocks. I often also hide the clock widget on my
    laptop's taskbar so I'm not peeking at it too often&mdash;I can just look at
    my watch instead. I find I work best when there's as few moving parts (not
    controlled by me) on my screen as possible.
</p>

    As a final note, I use the Hank Green's Focus Friend app to additionally
    motivate me to keep on track. It also helps me get out of an unproductive
    rut by setting a quick five minute "focus" period and using that to just
    stand up and start moving. That is, anytime I'm taking a too-long break,
    perhaps after a meal or before I leave the study lounge to go get ready
    before bed, etc etc.
