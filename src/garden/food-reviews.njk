<p>
    The following shall contain lists of food reviews. This is as much for me as
    it is for your entertainment, so uh. Imperative mood incoming.
</p>

<p>Things that are good:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Bao on Craig Street is really nice. I especially love their tomato beef
        noodles.
    </li>
    <li>I'm kinda a sucker for lots of things with tomatoes, actually.</li>
    <li>Chipotle's chicken option is not bad! (At least, the one on Forbes)</li>
    <li>
        The hot pineapple soy milk tea from Yi Fang in Squirrel Hill was really
        surprisingly delicious, actually. Their recommendation for 0% sugar was
        correct, the pineapple supplied all the sugar needed. (These guys's
        typography is really pretty too, notice how the Taiwanese regular
        script(?) decorating their wall is hand-painted/sharpied!)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Things that are bad:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Overall, try to understand what you want, because it will vary through
        time. Do you crave flavors right now? Or if you consumed flavors, would
        you curl up and pass away?
    </li>
    <li>
        coconut flavor: DO NOT DRINK THE COCONUT FLAVOR. eat CAN work BUT BE
        VERY CAREFUL!!!!! DO NOT DRINK THE COCONUT FLAVOR!!!! (Hi this is future
        wade here to elaborate. This is the coconut artifical flavor. It's like
        some people's aversion to artificial grape or cherry. (I looove
        artificial grape, tending neutral toward artificial cherry) Real coconut
        juice (cream? soup? milk?) is fine.)
    </li>
    <li>
        ramen: I swear, this is always so mid. It's alright, but like, it's
        always JUST noodles. I could make this at home. Don't waste your money.
    </li>
    <li>
        double scoop of ice cream: TOO MUCH ICE CREAM! YEOWCH! This extends to
        all things that you think might be too much sweet. Ice cream floats are
        delish though.
    </li>
    <li>
        cotton candy: good for the teensiest of bits. make sure you're eating
        with friends.
    </li>
    <li>
        pulled pork: uhh. it's alright. could be better or worse. really think
        about getting it.
    </li>
    <li>generic milk tea has gotten old.</li>
</ul>
