The following shall contain lists of food reviews. This is as much for me as
it is for your entertainment, so uh. Imperative mood incoming.

Things that are good:
- Bao on Craig Street is really nice. I especially love their tomato beef
  noodles.

- I'm kinda a sucker for lots of things with tomatoes, actually.

- Chipotle's chicken option is not bad! (At least, the one on Forbes)

- The hot pineapple soy milk tea from Yi Fang in Squirrel Hill was really
  surprisingly delicious, actually. Their recommendation for 0% sugar was
  correct, the pineapple supplied all the sugar needed. (These guys's
  typography is really pretty too, notice how the Taiwanese regular
  script(?) decorating their wall is hand-painted/sharpied!)

Things that are bad:

- Overall, try to understand what you want, because it will vary through
  time. Do you crave flavors right now? Or if you consumed flavors, would
  you curl up and pass away?

- coconut flavor: DO NOT DRINK THE COCONUT FLAVOR. eat CAN work BUT BE
  VERY CAREFUL!!!!! DO NOT DRINK THE COCONUT FLAVOR!!!! (Hi this is future
  wade here to elaborate. This is the coconut artifical flavor. It's like
  some people's aversion to artificial grape or cherry. (I looove
  artificial grape, tending neutral toward artificial cherry) Real coconut
  juice (cream? soup? milk?) is fine.)

- ramen: I swear, this is always so mid. It's alright, but like, it's
  always JUST noodles. I could make this at home. Don't waste your money.

- double scoop of ice cream: TOO MUCH ICE CREAM! YEOWCH! This extends to
  all things that you think might be too much sweet. Ice cream floats are
  delish though.

- cotton candy: good for the teensiest of bits. make sure you're eating
  with friends.

- pulled pork: uhh. it's alright. could be better or worse. really think
  about getting it.

  - generic milk tea has gotten old.
